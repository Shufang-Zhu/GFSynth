Compilation Instructions for Gfsynth using CMake

==== Install CUDD ====

0.1 Make sure CUDD is installed. CUDD can be found at:
    https://github.com/KavrakiLab/cudd.git

0.2 Install CUDD:
    ./configure --enable-silent-rules --enable-obj --enable-dddmp --prefix=[install location]
    sudo make install

    If you get an error about aclocal, this might be due to either
    a. Not having automake:
       sudo apt-get install automake
    b. Needing to reconfigure, do this before configuring:
       autoreconf -i

==== Install FLEX, BISON ====

0.3 Install flex and bison:
    sudo apt-get install flex bison

==== Install MONA ====

0.4 You probably want MONA if you are using Gfsynth:
    sudo apt-get install mona
    
==== Install Slugs ====
  
0.5 Make submodules folder where Slugs should be:

    mkdir submodules && cd submodules

0.6 Download Slugs which can be found at:
    https://github.com/VerifiableRobotics/slugs  

0.7 Make sure Slugs is installed:
    cd slugs && cd src && make   
	   

==== Install Gfsynth ====

1. Make build folder so your directory is not flooded with build files:

   mkdir build && cd build

2. Run CMake to generate the makefile:

   cmake ..

3. Compile using the generated makefile:

   make


==== Run Gfsynth ====

1. Reach executable file Gfsynth

   cd bin

2. Put the executable file of Slugs into the same folder:

   cp ../../submodules/slugs/src/slugs slugs

3. Put the Slugs parser folder into the same foler:

   cp -rf ../../submodules/slugs/tools/StructuredSlugsParser StructuredSlugsParser

4. Run example tcp_hanshake:

   ./Gfsynth ../../example/tcp_handshake
